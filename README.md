## What ?
* This repository is used to store submissions of HackerRank problems written in TypeScript

## Why
* Currenty, Hacker Rank only support JavaScript, but i want to be able to use TypeScript for the reason below:
  * Type checking
  * Better tools support (WebStorm, VSCode)
  * Able to debug offline
  * Able to run my own UT
  * Store my subsmission in a central part
